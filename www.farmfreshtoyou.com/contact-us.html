                <p class="answer collapse collapseQuestion206">
                    <span class="bolder">Your Subscription Price: </span>Your subscription price is the base price of your box before customizing. The subscription price includes a seasonal mix of 100% certified-organic produce based on your box type, size and delivery area. The price also covers the cost of growing, harvesting, packing and delivering your produce with the highest of food safety standards while providing sustainable jobs for our family of employees and other farms with which we partner.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="bolder">Market Specials Price: </span>The market specials pricing as shown is only applicable for spending above your base subscription amount.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="bolder">Produce Total: </span>The total listed in green at the top of the "In Your Box" panel cannot go below your base subscription price. The price of your customized produce box is a combination of subscription prices (for $ calculating up to your base amount) and discount market specials prices (for any $ exceeding your base amount.) Please keep in mind that because we offer the flexibility for you to change the original box contents that make up your base subscription price, should you choose to remove items, some of the new produce you add may contribute to your base price. Calculating the market special prices alone for each item in your box will not be a reliable indicator of your produce total as those discounted prices only apply for spending over your base subscription price.
                    <br><br>
                    The individual price of each produce item "In Your Box" is not displayed because they are not offered as stand-alone products. You can tinker with the items in your box until your produce total is an amount you feel comfortable placing as your order.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="bolder">Farm Product Price: </span>Farm products are optional items you can add to your delivery. As they are not included in the base subscription price of your produce box, they are listed separately, each with their own price.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="bolder">Total Order Price: </span>When customizing your box, you can view the total price of your upcoming delivery on the Order Summary page. You'll see the price of your customized produce box as well as the price of any farm products, recurring items or produce cases added to the delivery. On the Order Summary page, you'll also have the option to edit your delivery. Please remember, you can no longer change your delivery after 6 p.m., 2 days prior to your delivery day.

                    When customizing your box in our Farm Stand Market, you are not able to reduce your box size or remove items from your box to lower the price of your delivery.

Case boxes will be delivered to your home or office just like your regular Farm Fresh To You deliveries. The case boxes may arrive in special boxes depending on the produce item.

                <p class="answer collapse collapseQuestion212">
                    We offer a selection of dairy products (such as milk, butter and yogurt), sustainably raised meat and milk/meat alternatives that can be added to your delivery when customizing your box.<br><br>Dairy and meat items are delivered outside of your produce box, tucked into separate insulated envelopes/packages with an ice pack/s. You must receive a produce box in order to receive add-on dairy or meat products. <span style="font-style:italic;">Some dairy items can be added as automatic Recurring Add-On Items via your <a href="account/manageservices">Manage Services</a> page.</span><br>
                    <br>
                    The meat items arriving in your delivery have been frozen and vacuum-packaged at the peak of freshness. Although your meat should arrive frozen, it is possible that some thawing and condensation may occur which should not affect the quality of the product. Should you experience any issue with your meat delivery, please notify us immediately. Find more information on food safety in our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> policy under Deliveries, section 4.6.<br>
                    <br>
                    Glass milk bottles and some other dairy items require an additional bottle deposit charge at time of purchase. When empty bottles are returned, this deposit will be credited to your Farm Fresh To You account during your next billing cycle. Deposits and credits appear on the Transaction History tab of your <a href="/account">Account Summary</a> page > Account History section. To return glass bottles, please rinse the bottles thoroughly and place on your front doorstep for pickup by your farm delivery driver the night prior to your next delivery. Caps/lids should be recycled; it is not necessary to return them. Learn more about what items should be left out for pickup in our <a href="contact-us.html#topic4">Delivery FAQs</a>.

                <p class="answer collapse collapseQuestion213">
                    A Recurring Item <span style="font-style:italic;">(previously called a Mini Service)</span> is a farm product you can choose to have <span style="font-style:italic;" class="bolder">automatically added to each delivery</span>. Once a Recurring Item is added to a farm box service, the item/s will be delivered on the same frequency as your produce box and will continue until the recurrence or item is removed, either on your Recurring Items page (via your <a href="account/manageservices">Manage Services</a> page) or when customizing your box.<br>
                    <br>
                    As Recurring Items act like mini subscriptions and must be available to our members year-round, only a handful of our artisan farm products (like fresh eggs, organic apple juice, etc.) have the availability to be offered as Recurring Items. Likewise, given the seasonal nature of produce, fruits and vegetables are not available on a recurring basis. Visit your Recurring Items page (via your <a href="account/manageservices">Manage Services</a> page)&nbsp;for a list of items eligible for your delivery area. You can also add/edit Recurring Items when customizing your box.

                    On the Farm Products page, the Recently Purchased button is meant to help you easily find the items you use most.

For example, if you bought Capay Organic Heirloom Salsa on August 4th but don't see it listed the following week, on August 11th, it means the salsa is not currently available for purchase. When we have more available, you'll see it listed in your Recently Purchased category.

                            <h4>Program Changes and Termination</h4>
                            <p>Farm Fresh To You reserves the right, for any reason, to change or terminate all or any portion of the Refer-A-Friend program, also known as "Share a Bunch – Save a Bunch," at any time, without prior notice or future obligation, by posting a notice at <a href="contact-us.html" target="#">www.farmfreshtoyou.com/contact-us</a>. Your participation in this program constitutes your consent and agreement to abide by these terms and conditions, including subsequent revisions.</p>
                            <h4>Refer-A-Friend Promotional Credits &amp; Requirements/Limits</h4>
                            <p>Refer-A-Friend Promotional Credits, also known as Referral Credits, are credits issued as a promotional incentive, have no intrinsic value and cannot be redeemed for cash or applied to previous orders. Earned referral credits are applied to your Farm Fresh To You account for use on future deliveries. If you are the referring individual ("referrer"), your credit will apply to your account once the individual referred (“friend”) receives their first delivery. If you are the referred friend, your credit will be applied to your account once your first delivery has been made. For the referral credit amounts currently being offered by the Company, please refer to the Refer-A-Friend <a href="/give-and-save/refer-a-friend">About Page</a>. <span class="plain-italic">Note: In May of 2016, the Company increased the referral credit amount being issued to the friend (individual signing up for the Company's service) to $15, previously at $10; referrer's credit did not change.</span></p><br><br>
                            <p><span class="bolder">For the referrer (individual recommending the Company’s service)</span>, to earn a referral credit, you must first generate your unique Refer-A-Friend promotion code on the Refer-A-Friend <a href="/give-and-save/refer-a-friend">About Page</a>. <span class="bolder">You must also be a customer of the Company with both an active subscription and an account that is in good standing (is not delinquent or in collections status).</span></p><br><br>
                            <p>To receive a referral credit, the friend you refer must either be a new customer to the Company or a previous customer whose subscription has been inactive for a minimum of 3 months. Your friend must also reside in our delivery areas and otherwise meet the requirements set forth in our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>. In order for you to receive a referral credit, your friend must submit your specific referral code at the time of signing up for service. </p><br><br>
                            <p>Your referral credit is applied to your Farm Fresh To You account once your friend receives their first delivery. Referral credits are held in your account and will be automatically applied to future delivery purchases. It is your responsibility to visit the Company website to periodically review your account and check that your referral credits have been issued to you. You will not receive a referral credit if your friend cancels before their first delivery. You will not receive a referral credit if you do not have an active subscription at the time your promo code is used.</p><br><br>
                            <p>You cannot use your own Refer-A-Friend code for yourself, for other members of your household, for individuals who are currently subscribed to the Farm Fresh To You service, or for previous customers whose accounts have been inactive for less than 3 months. You may not create or use multiple accounts with the Company, for yourself or the same person (including with different email or delivery addresses) in order to generate additional referral credits. You may not invite friends or create accounts with the Company using false names, individuals not residing at the delivery address or any instances deemed by the Company as deceptive, misleading and/or in violation of Company policies in any way. Any individual who attempts to defraud Company in any way will also be subject to prosecution to the fullest extent of the law.</p><br><br>
                            <p>You may not spam or send unsolicited email to persons you don't personally know to collect referral credits. The referral email function on our Company <a href="/give-and-save/ways-to-share">Ways To Share</a> limits the number of email invitations to each friend (email address) to no more than 1 per day, 2 per week and/or 6 total. An option for your friend to opt out of future Refer-A-Friend emails sent from the Company will be provided. Should your friend opt out of Company referral emails but still sign up for the Company service using your unique referral code, you will still be eligible for a referral credit should all other requirements be met.</p><br><br>
                            <p>Your referral code may be shared on your own on social media, blogs and websites. However, you may not post your referral code to websites, including coupon or deal websites, that are not your own. Referral codes posted, either by yourself or others, to deal/coupon and/or other websites that are not your own, are a prohibited method of obtaining referral credits and will be reviewed by the Company, and are subject to immediate referral code termination, and/or may lead to the forfeiture of existing referral invitations and accrued, but not yet used, referral credits. On your <a href="/give-and-save/your-referrals">Referrals</a> page, we will display which of your friends have used your referral code to sign up for Farm Fresh To You service.</p><br><br>
                            <p>Should you choose to suspend, place on vacation hold or otherwise cancel your Farm Fresh To You account, any existing referral credits, obtained while your subscription was active, will remain on your account should your account become active and/or you begin receiving deliveries. Referral credits cannot be transferred to another member's account.</p><br><br>
                            <p>For <span class="bolder">the friend (individual signing up for the Company's service)</span>, the credit is applied to your account at the time of first delivery, given you are either a new customer or a previous customer whose subscription has been inactive for a minimum of 3 months and whose previous account with the Company was in good standing (is not delinquent or in collections status).</p>

                            <h4>Sharing of Personal Information</h4>
                            <p>Participation in the Program may require you to submit personal information about your friends, such as name and email address. You agree to receive communications from us with regards to your participation in the referral program, and to allow us to communicate with your friends about your participation (for example, by disclosing to your friends that an invite was sent by you). Any information collected from you or your friends as part of the referral program will be subject to our <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.
